This project's goal is to automate the summer housing selection process at Camp Sealth.

The main goal is to match compatible coworkers based on their location and living preferences
(such as early riser, messy, etc.). The preliminary deciders should be
1. gender (only one gender can inhabit a single living space)
2. unit (location is very important, particularly to counselors who will be living with their campers
3. living preferences based on answers to a google form and downloaded as a csv file
    ****the file should not have any commas in the questions or answers because that will mess up the parsing****
